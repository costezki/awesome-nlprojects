HTM is well suited to a wide variety of problems, particularly those with the following characteristics:
.   Streaming data rather than static databases
.    Underlying patterns in the data change over time
.    Many individual data sources where hand crafting separate models is impractical
.    Subtle patterns that canâ€™t always be seen by humans
.    Time-based patterns
.    Simple techniques such as thresholds yield substantial false positives and false negatives
. [link]	(https://github.com/carver/pyHTM)

It supports different deterministic and probabilistic reasoning mechanisms, clustering, classification and segmentation methods, and includes query interfaces as well as visualization tools.
